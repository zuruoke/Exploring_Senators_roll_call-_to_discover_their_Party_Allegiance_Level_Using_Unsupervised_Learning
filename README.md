# Exploring_Senators_roll_call_votes_to_discover_their_Party_Allegiance_Level_Using_Unsupervised_Learning

In the US, the Senate votes on proposed legislation. 
Getting a bill passed by the Senate is a key step towards getting its provisions enacted. A majority vote is required to get a bill passed.

The results of these votes, known as roll call votes.

Senators typically vote in accordance with how their political party votes, known as voting along party lines.

I'll be working on a dataset that contains all of the results of roll call votes from the 114th Senate. 
Each row represents a single Senator, and each column represents a vote.

I'll be using this dataset to explore and analyze Senators' roll call votes to discover their Party Allegiance Level 




In this mission, I'll:


1. Create an initial cluster using the kMeans Model

2. Train a model on the entire dataset using kMeans Model

3. Discover Senators who are more or less in the mainstream of their party.

4. Discover Senators who are more or less extremist of their party

Clustering voting data of Senators is particularly interesting because it can expose patterns that go deeper than party affiliation. 
For example, some Republicans are more liberal than the rest of their party. 
Looking at voting data can help us discover the Senators who are more or less in the mainstream of their party.
